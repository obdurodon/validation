TODO
- basic HTML validation
    automatic detection not recognizing SVG with XHTML 1.0, works if overridden with HTML5
    require doctype to be html5 (simple or legacy?) unless switch for legacy where we'll override and make known
    simple = <!DOCTYPE html>
    legacy = <!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "about:legacy-compat">

- check links
    exclude mailtos
    include redirects
    don't need anchors
    remove file:/// from links
    hack the robot checking?
        webcheck allows ignoring robots options but outputs an html file
    403 responses from actual site?
    
- add logic to check public_html directories


OPTIONS
- make checking links an option to save time checking static pages? (put on hold while dealing with robots issue)
- debug mode with all output
- save output to file (-s)
- css profile type choice?
- switch for legacy code
- use specified directory
- project vs public directory
